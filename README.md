osrm-processing-script
======================

Shell script to automate OSRM data processing.

This script can perform any or all of:

* Download and/or update an OSM PBF file
* Pre-process into OSRM data files
* Run OSRM server

The script is intended to be used on an Amazon EC2 instance based on ami-dc92f7b5 and is also included with that AMI.

None of this comes with any warranty, expressed or implied. It works for me.
